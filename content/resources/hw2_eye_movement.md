We collected gaze tracking data from human subjects watching video clips from the [Hollywood2 Humans and Scenes Dataset](http://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/actions/hollywood2/), a standard benchmark dataset for testing automated activity recognition algorithms.  Gaze data was collected using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker while subjects performed the same 12-class action recognition task laid out in the protocol for the evaluation of machine vision systems.
