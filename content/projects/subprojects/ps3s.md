This page is devoted to our (now decommissioned) cluster of 10 Sony Playstation3’s. While obviously intended as a gaming system, the PS3’s unique IBM Cell BE processor made it an impressive stream processing computer, capable of performance far exceeding traditional CPUs, at least for some kinds of problems. Even better, the PS3 was inexpensive and compact, with thermal and power consumption characteristics commensurate with a device that is meant to live in a living room. We built this cluster of 10 PS3’s (along with a sister cluster at MIT) to help us build artificial visual systems inspired by the brain. [Click here](/project/computation) for more project details.
