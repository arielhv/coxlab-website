While my time at the Rowland Institute has been amazing, my
(five-year, non-renewable) term here is up, and it's time for me
to move on.

Luckily, I won't have to move far, as I will be joining the Dept.
of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Center for Brain Science
over on the main campus here at Harvard.  I'm extremely excited by
the new opportunities that joining this community opens up, and I very much
look forward to starting this fall!
