We'd like to thank the <a href="http://www.smithfamilyfoundation.net/">Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Family Foundation</a> for their generous support of my group's work via the <a href="http://www.hria.org/tmfservices/tmfgrants/smith.html">Smith Family Awards Program for Excellence in Biomedical Research</a>.  The Smith Family Foundation's gift will support research on the nature of plasticity in the visual cortex of developing animals.
