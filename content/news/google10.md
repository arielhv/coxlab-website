We're grateful and honored to have just been selected to receive a Google Research Award to help support our work with biologically-inspired vision systems.  The Google Research Award program is part of Google's broader effort to engage and support academic faculty pursuing research topics of mutual interest.  We're looking forward to working more closely with Google in the future. See the official announcement [here](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2010/07/announcing-our-q2-research-awards.html).
