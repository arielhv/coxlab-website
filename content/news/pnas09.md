In our new [paper in PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/08/0811583106.full.pdf+html), we present evidence that rats can perform high-level transformation-tolerant visual object recognition, an ability not traditionally ascribed to rodents. We believe that the availability of rats as a model system for high-level has great potential to accelerate our understanding of high-level vision, by providing a simpler, more accessible example system to study.
