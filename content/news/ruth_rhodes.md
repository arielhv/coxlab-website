Congrats to lab member Ruth Fong on <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2014/11/ruth-c-fong-15-named-rhodes-scholar">being named a Rhodes Scholar</a>.  Ruth's been doing some exciting new work extending our <a href="/pdfs/2014_scheirer_tpami.pdf">perceptual annotation</a> approach to machine learning, which leverages neuroscience-derived data to build better machine learning systems.  Ruth will continue her studies in machine learning and computer science at Oxford as part of this prestigious award.
