An online streaming version of a talk that Nicolas and I made in September at the GPU Technology Conference is now available [here](http://nvidia.fullviewmedia.com/gtc2010/0922-san-jose-2204.html).  In it, we talk about our work using GPUs to tackle large-scale face recognition problems.

Also, be sure to check out Nicolas' talk on [GPU Metaprogramming Techniques](http://nvidia.fullviewmedia.com/gtc2010/0923-a1-2176.html).
