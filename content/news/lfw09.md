Our latest results on the “Labeled Faces in the Wild” face recognition were just posted to the official LFW website ([http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html)), where we currently have the best reported performance with our “V1-like” model. However, at the same time, we argue that even more realistic test sets are needed – to find out more, see our latest [CVPR paper](http://www.rowland.harvard.edu/cox/publications/pinto-dicarlo-cox-cvpr-2009-mkl.pdf).
