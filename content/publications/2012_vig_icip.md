Local spatiotemporal descriptors are being successfully used as a powerful video representation for action recognition. Particularly competitive recognition performance is achieved when these descriptors are densely sampled on a regular grid; in contrast to existing approaches that are based on features at interest points, dense sampling captures more contextual information, albeit at high computational cost. We here com- bine advantages of both dense and sparse sampling. Once de- scriptors are extracted on a dense grid, we prune them either randomly or based on a sparse saliency mask of the underly- ing video. The method is evaluated using two state-of-the-art algorithms on the challenging Hollywood2 benchmark. Clas- sification performance is maintained with as little as 30% of descriptors, while more modest saliency-based pruning of de- scriptors yields improved performance. With roughly 80% of descriptors of the Dense Trajectories model, we outperform all previously reported methods, obtaining a mean average precision of 59.5%.
