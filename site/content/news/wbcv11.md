I'm helping to organize a workshop at the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference this year in Colorado Springs on "Biologically Consistent Computer Vision."  We received an impressive array of submissions, and the workshop promises to be a good opportunity for those interested in biologically-inspired vision to come together and share ideas.
