Many thanks to NVIDIA for supplying GPU hardware for our formidable new GPU cluster, which features five GTX280s, five Tesla C1060s and two Tesla S1070 quad GPU 1U rack modules.

We’ll be making these systems available for the students of MIT’s “CUDA @ MIT” independent activities period, in order to help spread the joy of GPU to our friends down the river.
