Half of the fun of doing science is devising new tools with which to measure things. The purpose of this section is to eventually serve as a repository for some of those tools weâ€™ve been working on when they become ready to be shared with a broader audience.

We have lots of things cooking behind the scenes at the moment, but here are few things that may be of general interest:

* A portable, hand-held Kinect depth camera [hack](/projects/subprojects/kinect)
* An open-source self-calibrating [eyetracking device](/projects/subprojects/eye_tracker) (designed for use with animals, but potentially useful for humans as well)
